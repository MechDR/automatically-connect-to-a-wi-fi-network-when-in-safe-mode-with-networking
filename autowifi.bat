ECHO ^|          Automatically connect to a Wi-Fi network when in           ^|
ECHO ^|                      Safe Mode with Networking                      ^|
ECHO ^|                                V1.0                                 ^|
ECHO ^+---------------------------------------------------------------------^+
ECHO ^| This script is supposed to circumvent a ^"bug^" that Microsoft        ^|
ECHO ^| obviously forgot it exists. Safe Mode with Networking IS supposed   ^|
ECHO ^| to be just that^: a minimal boot environment with a fully working    ^|
ECHO ^| networking layer.                                                   ^|
ECHO ^|                                                                     ^|
ECHO ^| Well, as far sa Microsoft is concerned, Wi-Fi apparently isn^'t a    ^|
ECHO ^| part of the networking layer. Some systems have the WLAN AutoConfig ^|
ECHO ^| service set to Manual, even if the OS is installed on a laptop and  ^|
ECHO ^| it obviously has a Wi-Fi adapter. Sure, the service boots up when   ^|
ECHO ^| the drivers load and you try to connect to an access point          ^|
ECHO ^| ^(network^), but that^'s when the OS is booted in regular mode ^(not    ^|
ECHO ^| Safe Mode with Networking^).                                         ^|
ECHO ^|                                                                     ^|
ECHO ^| Not only that but Microsoft considers this a FAD, LOL ^:D. According ^|
ECHO ^| to them, not having Wi-Fi access while in Safe Mode with Networking ^|
ECHO ^| is a FAD... I had no idea that Wi-Fi adapters are not networking    ^|
ECHO ^| equpment, LOL ^:D.                                                   ^|
ECHO ^|                                                                     ^|
ECHO ^| Let^'s say you have to do something for a client remotely in Safe    ^|
ECHO ^| Mode. You^'re thinking ^"Hmmm... Safe Mode with Networking^? Should    ^|
ECHO ^| work, right ^:)^?^". Incorrect! On some installs, the service won^'t    ^|
ECHO ^| run Automatically, on other installs, you have to manually connect  ^|
ECHO ^| to the Wi-Fi network that the rig ^(laptop^/PC^) was connected to      ^|
ECHO ^| while the OS was booted in regular mode... which basically means    ^|
ECHO ^| that, if there^'s no one at the other end that you can instruct how  ^|
ECHO ^| to help you connect the rig to the internet, you can^'t continue     ^|
ECHO ^| working on the damn thing. Not only that, but since you probably    ^|
ECHO ^| booted in Safe Mode with Networking through msconfig ^(Win ^+ R --^>   ^|
ECHO ^| msconfig --^> Enter --^> Boot tab --^> Boot options --^> Safe boot --^>  ^|
ECHO ^| Network^), when the person that^'s using the laptop^/PC sits in front  ^|
ECHO ^| of it and thinks the problem you were working on is solved and now  ^|
ECHO ^| he^/she can finally get some work done, guess what... they^'re stuck  ^|
ECHO ^| in Safe Mode with Networking. Yep, no matter how many times they    ^|
ECHO ^| reboot the rig, the setting is permanent unless you manually change ^|
ECHO ^| it back to not boot in any kind of Safe Mode. And how are you       ^|
ECHO ^| supposed to do that if you can^'t actually remote in and switch it   ^|
ECHO ^| back. See what I^'m getting at. You have to harass the client ^(who   ^|
ECHO ^| might not be tech savvy at all^), send videos or screenshots on how  ^|
ECHO ^| to configure back the rig to boot in normal mode, and not only      ^|
ECHO ^| that, but the problem you were working on is not solved^! You can    ^|
ECHO ^| imagine how pissed off you^'d be if this happened to you... I know I ^|
ECHO ^| would be.                                                           ^|
ECHO ^|                                                                     ^|
ECHO ^| Sorry for the rant, but I just had to vent since it has happened to ^|
ECHO ^| me on a number or occasions and I^'m getting pretty tired of having  ^|
ECHO ^| to explain to clients that it^'s not actually my fault, it^'s         ^|
ECHO ^| Microsoft^'s fault.                                                  ^|
ECHO ^|                                                                     ^|
ECHO ^| Anyhow, run the script once to install the ^"hack^" ^(with             ^|
ECHO ^| administrative privileges, right click --^> Run as administrator^)    ^|
ECHO ^| that removes the ^"bug^", run it again to remove the changes and      ^|
ECHO ^| revert everything back to the way it was ^(once again, with          ^|
ECHO ^| administrative privileges^). A detailed explanation on what          ^|
ECHO ^| information the script will need as input follows.                  ^|
